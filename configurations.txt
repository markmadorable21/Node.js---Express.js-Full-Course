node.js = server-side applications
= environment to run JS outside the browser
= built on Chrome's V8 JS Engine
= no DOM, no window, server side apps, filesystem, versions, CommonJS

1. install node.js LTS version
2. check version by typing in the terminal:
    node --version
3. to evaluate our node, we can use Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) or CLI
    REPL is for playing around
    CLI is for everything
4. to use REPL, type in the terminal:
    node
  to close:
    Ctrl+C
5. create a folder for your project and cd to that folder in the terminal
  to run app.js, in the terminal enter:
    node app.js
6. we can use VS code terminal to run node.js by using Ctrl+` and then redo step 5.

GLOBALS = NO Window

__dirname = path to current directory
__filename = file name
require = function to use modules (CommonJS)
module = info about current module (file)
process = info about env where the program is being executed

shortcut for copying a line Shift + Alt + Arrow

CommonJS, every file is module (by default)
Modules = Encapsulated Code (only share minimum)

every file is a module where methods and variables only accessible within the module itself

for path, 1 dot for inside the folder, 2 dots to go outside the path where the file is

BUILT-IN Modules
built-in modules don't need to install, unlike external modules that need to be downloaded
1. OS =
2. PATH = 
3. File System = synchronous, asynchronous
node overwrites the content of the file when writing new content

we can add flag in WriteFileSync using 'a' to append

4. HTTP = 

+================================================
NPM configurations
npm local package install:
    npm i <packageName>

npm global package install:
    npm install -g <packageName>

to add package.json for dependency packages
    npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
    npm init -y (everything default)

installing dev_dependencies
npm i nodemon -D

if we have package.json after cloning a project folder from GH, we only type:
    npm install (npm will check package.json and install dependencies, expect to have node_modules folder created)

in the package.json/scripts, add nodemon app.js as value in a start key then type this command below to run app.js using nodemon:
    npm start

same above in dev key, add nodemon app.js to run the backend with nodemon:
    npm run dev 
to exit:
    Ctrl+C

EXPRESS
