node.js = server-side applications
= environment to run JS outside the browser
= built on Chrome's V8 JS Engine
= no DOM, no window, server side apps, filesystem, versions, CommonJS

1. install node.js LTS version
2. check version by typing in the terminal:
    node --version
3. to evaluate our node, we can use Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) or CLI
    REPL is for playing around
    CLI is for everything
4. to use REPL, type in the terminal:
    node
  to close:
    Ctrl+C
5. create a folder for your project and cd to that folder in the terminal
  to run app.js, in the terminal enter:
    node app.js
6. we can use VS code terminal to run node.js by using Ctrl+` and then redo step 5.

every file is a module where methods and variables only accessible within the module itself

for path, 1 dot for inside the folder, 2 dots to go outside the path where the file is
